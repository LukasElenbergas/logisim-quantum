# Logisim Quantum
A fork of Logisim 2.7.1 aimed to implement a portion of quantum logic gates into the tool to expand its capabilities.
This tool facilitates both quantum and classic logic gate functionality in the hopes to educate about both types of 
computation paradigms and the possible interactions between them.
